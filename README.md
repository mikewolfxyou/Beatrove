- No server installation required - runs entirely in the browser

### Quick Start

1. **Download or Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/beatrove.git
   cd beatrove
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies (Optional - for testing)**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Open in Browser**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Direct file access
   open index.html

   # Option 2: Local server (recommended)
   npm run serve
   # Then visit http://localhost:8000

   # Option 3: Python server
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```

3. **Prepare Your Music Data**
   - Create a tracklist file with this format:
     ```
     artist - title - key - BPM.extension - track time - year - path - genre - Energy # - Record Label
     ```
   - Save as `tracklist.csv` in the root directory for auto-loading

### Example Tracklist Format
```
&ME - Confusion - 5A - 120.flac - 6:56 - 2021 - /path/to/file.flac - Electro - Energy 5 - Keinemusik

```

## 🛠️ Local Development Workflow

### Backend (Vinyl OCR API)
1. **Environment setup**
   ```bash
   cd server
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   export VINYL_OCR_HTTP_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8089"
   export VINYL_OCR_PROMPT='You are an expert archivist for vinyl records. Respond ONLY with JSON like {"artist":"","composer":"","record_name":"","catalog_number":"","label":"","year":"","location":"","notes":""}. Fill empty strings when unknown.'
   export VINYL_OCR_MODEL="nanonets/Nanonets-OCR2-3B"
   export VINYL_OCR_TEMPERATURE="0.0"
   export VINYL_OCR_MAX_TOKENS="15000"
   # If you only provide the host (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:8089) the app automatically calls /v1/chat/completions.
   # Optional CLI fallback
   # export VINYL_OCR_COMMAND="python /path/to/ocr.py --image {image}"
   cd ..
   ```
2. **Start the API**
   ```bash
   uvicorn server.app:app --reload --port 9000
   ```
   This launches the FastAPI service, writes data to `server/vinyl.db`, and serves uploaded cover images from `server/uploads/`. Endpoints live under `http://localhost:9000/api/v1`.

### Frontend (Beatrove Web UI)
1. **Install deps and serve**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run serve
   # browse http://localhost:8000
   ```
2. **Enable vinyl mode** in `assets/js/core/security-utils.js`:
   ```js
   VINYL_MODE: {
     ENABLED: true,
     API_BASE_URL: 'http://localhost:9000/api/v1',
     IMAGE_BASE_URL: 'http://localhost:9000'
   }
   ```
3. **Upload covers** using the Vinyl Intake card (visible when vinyl mode is enabled). Select multiple images (front/back/liner notes) in one submission; the backend merges OCR results and refreshes the UI automatically.

Stop both servers with `Ctrl+C`. Reactivate the Python venv (`source server/venv/bin/activate`) whenever you restart the backend.

## 🐍 Python Helper Scripts

Beatrove includes two Python utility scripts to help prepare your music collection for optimal use with the application.

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT: Backup Your Music Collection**
> Before using these scripts, especially `music_file_fixer.py`, **always create a complete backup of your music files**. The filename fixing script will rename your audio files, and while it includes safety checks, it's essential to have a backup in case you need to revert changes. Consider using a backup tool or simply copying your music directory to a safe location before proceeding.

### 📝 generate_music_list.py

3. Audio files will be matched by filename
4. Enjoy previewing your tracks with the visualizer

### 🎨 Cover Art Setup

#### **Directory Structure**
```
Your-Music-Folder/
├── Artist - Title - Key - BPM.flac
├── Artist - Title - Key - BPM.mp3
└── artwork/                    ← Cover art directory
    ├── Artist - Title.jpg      ← Simplified naming (new)
    ├── Artist - Title.jpeg
    ├── Artist - Title.png
    └── Artist - Title.webp
```

#### **Supported Image Formats**
- **.jpg** (JPEG) - Recommended for smaller file sizes
- **.jpeg** (JPEG)
- **.png** (Portable Network Graphics)
- **.webp** (WebP)

#### **File Naming Convention**
Cover art files use a simplified **Artist - Title** format:

**Audio File:** `Deadmau5 - Strobe - 8A - 126.flac`
**Cover Art:** `artwork/Deadmau5 - Strobe.jpg`

*Note: Legacy full filename format (`Artist - Title - Key - BPM.jpg`) is still supported for backward compatibility.*

#### **How It Works**
1. **Automatic Detection**: When you select an audio folder, Beatrove looks for an `artwork` subdirectory
2. **Smart Matching**: For each track, searches for cover art in priority order (jpg → jpeg → png → webp)
3. **Fallback**: Shows clean SVG placeholder when no cover art is found
4. **Toggle Control**: Use the 🎨 Cover Art button to show/hide artwork

#### **Using the Python Script**
Extract cover art automatically from your audio files:

```bash
# Extract cover art to default 'artwork' directory
python generate_music_list.py /path/to/music --extract-artwork

# Extract to custom directory
python generate_music_list.py /path/to/music --extract-artwork --artwork-dir ./album_covers
```

**Extraction Features:**
- Supports MP3 (ID3 tags) and FLAC (embedded pictures)
- Automatically detects JPEG/PNG formats
- Creates organized artwork directory with clean filenames
- Adds artwork paths to CSV output

## 📝 Data Format Notes

The application expects tracklist data in a specific format. The format supports multiple entry types:

- **Basic**: `artist - title - key - BPM.ext - time - year`
- **With Genre**: `artist - title - key - BPM.ext - time - year - genre`
- **With Path**: `artist - title - key - BPM.ext - time - year - path - genre`
- **With Energy**: `artist - title - key - BPM.ext - time - year - path - genre - Energy #`
- **Full Format**: `artist - title - key - BPM.ext - time - year - path - genre - Energy # - Record Label`

The parser intelligently detects file paths, genre tags, energy levels, and record labels in flexible positions.

## 📸 Vinyl OCR Pipeline (Optional)

If you want to manage physical vinyl by scanning cover art, enable the auxiliary ingestion server:

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r server/requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Configure OCR**
   - **HTTP model (recommended for http://127.0.0.1:8089)**:
     ```bash
     export VINYL_OCR_HTTP_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8089"
     export VINYL_OCR_PROMPT='You are an expert archivist for vinyl records. Respond ONLY with JSON like {"artist":"","composer":"","record_name":"","catalog_number":"","label":"","year":"","location":"","notes":""}. Fill empty strings when unknown.'
     export VINYL_OCR_MODEL="nanonets/Nanonets-OCR2-3B"
     export VINYL_OCR_TEMPERATURE="0.0"
     export VINYL_OCR_MAX_TOKENS="15000"
     ```
     The FastAPI server encodes the image as `data:<mime>;base64,<blob>` and POSTs a JSON payload with `model`, `temperature`, `max_tokens`, and a `messages` array (image + prompt). Customize these env vars if your OCR provider expects different parameters/language.
   - **CLI fallback**: alternatively point `VINYL_OCR_COMMAND` at a script/binary that writes JSON to STDOUT:
     ```bash
     export VINYL_OCR_COMMAND="python /path/to/ocr.py --image {image}"
     ```
3. **Run the API**:
   ```bash
   uvicorn server.app:app --reload --port 9000
   ```
4. **Enable vinyl mode** by setting `VINYL_MODE.ENABLED = true` in `assets/js/core/security-utils.js`. Update `API_BASE_URL`/`IMAGE_BASE_URL` if you use a different host or port.
5. **Upload covers** from a REST client or a small form (POST `/api/v1/records` with one or more `covers` files + optional fields). The server stores every image, runs your OCR command on each, merges the metadata, and returns the combined record.
6. **Use the built-in Vinyl Intake card** (shows up next to the search panel when vinyl mode is enabled) to drag/drop multiple sleeve photos directly from the UI, enter optional metadata, and trigger a catalog refresh automatically.
7. **Remove mistakes instantly:** when a vinyl track appears in the library, click the trash icon next to its controls to delete the underlying record from the auxiliary SQLite database. A confirmation protects against accidental removal.
8. **Single source of truth:** uploaded cover images are stored inline in the SQLite database as base64 data URIs, and the temporary files in `server/uploads/` are removed immediately after OCR runs. Older records that relied on `/uploads/...` URLs continue to work, but new entries no longer leave duplicate files on disk.

When vinyl mode is active, the frontend fetches `/api/v1/records` instead of `tracklist.csv`, automatically rendering each record (artist, composer, catalog number) with the uploaded cover art. The rest of the application—filtering, playlists, statistics—continues to work on the returned metadata. If the server is unreachable, Beatrove falls back to the traditional `tracklist.csv` workflow.
